# Python version of _ppdenoise_
This repository contains a Python port of Kovesi's phase preserving denoising algorithm, based on the Julia implementation (https://github.com/peterkovesi/ImagePhaseCongruency.jl/blob/master/src/phasecongruency.jl). See `2D_Implementation_Test.ipynb` for an example of use and comparison with output from the original code.
